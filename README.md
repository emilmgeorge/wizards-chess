# Wizard's Chess
## Introduction
Wizards Chess is an Arduino-powered chessboard project which uses speech recogniton to get the player's move. The speech recognition system is powered by CMUSphinx, the opensource speech recognition toolkit. The hardware is basically an x-y table with an attached magnet, which is placed under a chessboard with magnetic chess pieces.

Its making was inspired by the magical Wizard's Chess in the Harry Potter world.
